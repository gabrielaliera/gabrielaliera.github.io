## Project Summary
***
The Stay Stocked app is a user-friendly mobile application designed to help individuals keep track of their groceries. Users can search for food and add food to a list. By facilitating better management of food waste and encouraging budget consciousness, this app is a valuable tool for users. 

## Features
***
 - Users can search for food of choice e.g bread, salt
 - User can view food item information
 - Users can save item to a list
 - User can view items save to list

## Lessons Learned
***
Creating this code sample provided valuable insights and skills in collaborative group work. I learn to work in a team to develop an app starting from ideation/design to development.  I also learned to utilize Git for effective collaboration, merging features, resolving merge conflicts, and handling pull requests.

Additionally, I learned to integrate an HTTP client library to obtain authorization tokens for API authentication. This involved understanding the token acquisition process and securely incorporating it into requests.

Furthermore, I developed efficient JSON object parsing capabilities, enabling the extraction and presentation of essential information from the API response. This skill significantly enhanced user interaction with the app.

In summary, this code sample provided me with practical experience in collaborative teamwork, leveraging Git for version control, incorporating authorization tokens into API requests, and parsing JSON objects to display relevant data to the user.
