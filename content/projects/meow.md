## Project Summary
***
This project serves as a showcase of the diverse technologies I harnessed during my internship, allowing you to witness the practical application of my expertise and the growth of my capabilities. 

## Story
As a cat, you typically start your morning with a nice bowl of cat food, served to you by your faithful human companion. But this morning was different, you discover that your human has chosen to sleep in rather than prepare your meal. This is unacceptable, you decided to teach them a lesson with your patented Catrate Chop. 

## Gameplay
Cat paws rain from the top of the screen, matching the tempo of the background music. 

## Technologies Used

- [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)


## Challenges and Accomplishments
As a group of designers and programmers, our main challenges revolved around bridging the gap in our knowledge domains. Some of us were new to game development and Unity, while others were new to programming and diving into Git for the first time. Despite these hurdles, we managed to overcome them by communicating openly and patiently explaining concepts to one another.

This collaboration became crucial when we tackled the task of integrating custom animations with the codebase, ensuring that the animations played at the right moments.

In the end, we successfully created a playable game that encompassed all of our essential features as well as the additional stretch goals.

## What's Next?
Our enthusiasm and deep appreciation goes out to the organizers and mentors who orchestrated this remarkable IGNITE 2023 Game Jam by hosted by SOMOS - part of the Activision Blizzard Entertainment King network for proud Latina, Latino, Latine, and allies. This experience has been a profound learning journey for us. 

The current iteration of the game introduces the initial level of gameplay, and our vision is to infuse it with player sessions, save game functionality, and a richer tapestry of interactive animations, all guided by the same passion that drove us to participate in this extraordinary event.
