# Introduction
This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a **Production Engineer Intern** for [Major League Hacking Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/) in their Site Reliability Track, sponsored by [Meta](https://opensource.fb.com/partnerships/major-league-hacking/) Throughout this experience, I, along with 11 other individuals, embarked on the journey of learning DevOps tools while building a portfolio website with a CI/CD pipeline. 

# Highlights

üöÄ During these weeks, we kick-started the project by creating a basic **Flask** website using **Jinja** templates. I dived deep into CSS and learned **Bootstrap** to enhance the website's responsiveness and visual appeal. This was a personal goal of mine because my CSS skills could use an upgrade!

Embracing the **Agile Scrum** process, I actively participated in *stand-up notes* and *retrospectives*, promoting effective communication and continuous improvement within the team.

üîß **GitHub** collaboration was taken to new heights as I played a pivotal role in opening issues, creating feature branches, and initiating pull requests. These efforts contributed to smoother and more organized development cycles.

üåê I successfully deployed the website on a virtual private server using a **Digital Ocean** droplet, honing my **Linux** skills by working with **Bash** commands and crafting various *scripts* with loops and conditional statements, and commands like curl, awk, and jp. I even automated the process of running my portfolio in the background before moving it into a container.

üíª My scriptwriting skills improved significantly throughout the experience. I wrote a seamless script that deployed updates from GitHub, streamlining our development workflow and reducing downtime.

üß™ An essential milestone was learning about *unit testing, integration testing, and system testing*. I implementing **Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles** in order to create comprehensive tests to ensure the database connection and API endpoints were functioning as expected, prioritizing robustness and code quality.

üê≥ Working with **Docker** was a highlight, as I learned more about YAML and mastered Docker and **Docker Compose** to configure containers for MySQL and MyPortfolio. I also implemented a container for a reverse proxy server using **NGINX** for handling SSL certificates.

üéØ The fellowship provided an excellent opportunity to sharpen my interview skills, tackling coding challenges and introductory system design questions. Additionally, I had the privilege of engaging in technology discussions with esteemed mentors broadening my perspectives and fostering a growth-oriented mindset.

# What's Next
I'm incredibly grateful for the Major League Hacking Fellowship, which not only offered hands-on technical experience but also enabled collaboration with exceptional individuals in the tech industry. 

During the next six weeks, I will be learning about continuous integeration, monitoring, networking, and troubleshooting! 

I'm excited to apply everything I've learned and continue contributing to the ever-evolving world of technology!
